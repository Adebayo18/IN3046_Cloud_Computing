# Bug Tracking Application

This application focuses on making handling bug reports of different priority easier. It has two parts (The UI and the handler/message consumer) which are deployed separately into two different elastic compute instances on AWS. It creates 3 priority queues to store messages for different priority levels such as high, medium and low priority. The handler uses a scheduler which polls the priority queues for bug report messages at intervals of 10 seconds. Once it polls for messages and gets any message, it constructs messages in different forms to be consumed by different webhooks and clients. It sends the high priority bug reports to a slack channel using a webhook and then sends the medium and low priority bug report messages to receiver emails using Amazon SMTP. Once the messages are consumed and handled appropriately, the handlers then proceed to delete the messages from the queue to avoid multiple consumption of the messages.
